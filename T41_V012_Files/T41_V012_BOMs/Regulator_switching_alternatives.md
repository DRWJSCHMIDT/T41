# Switching alternatives

The BOMs specify linear regulators on all boards in order to keep "birdies" to a minimum. If you want to experiment with switching regulators instead, in order to reduce power consumption and heat dissipation, the following table specifies pin-compatible alternatives.

| Linear part # | Switching part # | Voltage out | Mouser PN |
|---------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| LM1117T-3.3/NOPB | OKI-78SR-3.3/1.5-W36-C | 3.3 V | 580-OKI78SR3.31.536C |
| LM7805CT/NOPB | OKI-78SR-5/1.5-W36-C | 5 V | 580-OKI78SR5/1.5W36C |
